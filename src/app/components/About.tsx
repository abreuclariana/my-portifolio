        I'm a developer with a passion for technology and programming, with a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from Estácio de Sá, and 3 years' solid experience in Web Development. I have experience in various technologies, including React, Next.js and other modern tools for creating web applications. My goal is always to deliver effective, high-quality solutions. In addition, I served for 3 years in the Brazilian Navy, where I worked as a User Support Technician in the Information Technology Service (ITS) sector at the Aratu Naval Base, giving me a broad view of information technology and systems.
